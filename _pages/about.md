- Assistant professor, Texas Tech University (Sept. 2017 – present) <br>
- Visiting research associate, Michigan State University (Aug. 2014 – Aug. 2017). <br>
  Mentor: [Prof. Andrew J. Christlieb](http://www.the-christlieb-group.org/)

Research Interests
======
My research interests mainly focus on scientific computing, numerical analysis and scientific machine learning. Topics of special interests include:
- Structure-preserving machine learning moment closures for kinetic models
- Adaptive sparse grid discontinuous Galerkin methods for high-dimensional PDEs
- Structure-preserving time discretizations for hyperbolic balance laws
- High order numerical boundary conditions for hyperbolic equations
- Boundary schemes of lattice Boltzmann method
