I am currently an assistant professor in [the Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/math/) at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/).

Education
======
- Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, University of Houston (2014). <br>
  Advisor: [Prof. Jing-Mei Qiu](https://jingmeiqiu.github.io/)


Professional Experience
======
- Assistant professor, Texas Tech University (Sept. 2017 – present).
- Visiting research associate, Michigan State University (Aug. 2014 – Aug. 2017). <br>
  Mentor: [Prof. Andrew J. Christlieb](http://www.the-christlieb-group.org/)

Research Interests
